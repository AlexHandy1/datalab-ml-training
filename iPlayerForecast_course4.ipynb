    "For regressors, the evaluation of the model is less straightforward and id usually based upon the average residual between the actual data and the model predictions. __Root mean squared error__ (RMSE) and __mean absolute error__ (MAE) are two commonly used examples of these. Once we have a representation of the error produced by the model we can compare that error with the error of the most simple model of the data (usually the mean). This statistic is known as the coefficient of determination or __R-squared__ and represents the part of variability the model managed to get.\n",
