# datalab-ml-training

## Objectives
The goals of this training is to:
- Get you excited about Data Science
- Give a quick introduction for some of the Python's libraries available: Pandas (data wrangling), Scikit-learn (ML), Matplotlib (visualisation)
- Give a quick overview of an approach to tackling Data Science Problems

We will not:
- Make you an expert Data Scientist
- Go into details (or do the maths) for the techniques / algorithms we will use
- Properly cover any deep learning / neural networks

## Getting ready
Before starting the training be sure to:
- Have the elevated access rights to be able to install softwares
- This code was developed for Python 3 and might not work with Python 2, so it's worth downloading Python from here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/python-3.6.1-macosx10.6.pkg
- Then run in the following in your terminal:
  - Pip3 install Jupyter - This will give you an interactive programming environment that runs in the browser (and created this notebook)
  - Pip3 install scikit-learn - This will provide you with powerful and easy to use machine learning algorithms
  - Pip3 install pandas - This will give you a powerful way of handling dataframes
  - Pip3 install numpy - This gives you access to scitific computing capability
  - Pip3 install scipy - Similar to Numpy, it gives you access to key mathematical functions
  - Pip3 install matplotlib - This will be used for plotting
- Finally, in order to start your developing environment, type Jupyter Notebook in your terminal. This should open a tab in your browser
Alternatively, you can also install a package manager such as Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) to install the different libraries without using terminal.

## Agenda
The training is split in 5 courses.
